**WE DO NOT COLLECT ANY DATA. PERIOD.**

We physically can’t.
We have nowhere to store it.
We don’t even have a server database to store it.
So even if Justin Bieber asked nicely to see your data, we wouldn’t have anything to show him.

That’s why, with Panic Painter, **what happens on your phone stays on your phone**.
