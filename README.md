Fulfill your clients' needs and grow your fame as an artist! Choose your paintbrush color by sliding across the color palette until you land on your selected color. To draw on canvases, you have two options:

* **Scribble:** To scribble on a canvas, triple click on it rapidly. It will apply your paintbrush color on that canvas.

* **Drag:** To paint multiple canvases at once, press down on a canvas then drag the mouse to another canvas. This will apply your paintbrush colors to the covered canvases.

⏲ Beware! There is a timer for the entire level as well as for each canvas. Canvases with more colors have longer time.

:recycle:  To restart the level, click on the top-left corner of the game window (In the game screen, not the title bar)
