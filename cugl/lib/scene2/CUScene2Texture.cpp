//  Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)
//
//  This module provides support for writing the results of a scene graph to
//  a texture. This is very helpful for doing simple multi-pass rendering.
//  You can render to a texture, and then post-process that texture
//  a second pass.
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.
