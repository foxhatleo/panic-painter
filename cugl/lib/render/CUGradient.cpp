//  CUGradient.cpp
//  Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)
//
//  This module provides support for a two-color gradient.  It uses a box
//  gradient definition to support both linear gradients and radial gradients
//  in addition to box gradients.
//
//  This module is based on he NVGpaint datatype from nanovg by Mikko Mononen
//  (memon@inside.org). It has been modified to support the CUGL framework.
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.
//
//  With that said, this class looks very similar to the classes in the math 
//  package in that has many methods that assume the object is on the stack and
//  not in a pointer.  That is because we often want to transform these objects
//  with math classes, but we still want shared pointer support for SpriteBatch
//  management.  The result is a class with a bit of a hybrid feel.
