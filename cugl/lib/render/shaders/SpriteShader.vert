R"(////////// SHADER BEGIN /////////
//  SpriteShader.vert
//  Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)
//
//  This is a full-power SpriteBatch vertex shader for both OpenGL and OpenGL ES.
//  It supports textures which can be tinted per vertex. It also supports gradients
//  (which can be used simulataneously with textures, but not with colors), as
//  well as a scissor mask.  Gradients use the color inputs as their texture
//  coordinates. Finally, there is support for very simple blur effects, which
//  are used for font labels.
