/**
 * Adds the given music asset to the background music queue
 *
 * Music is handled differently from sound effects. You can only play one
 * music asset at a time. However, it is possible to queue music assets
 * for immediate playback once the active asset is finished. Proper
 * queue management is the keep for smooth, uninterrupted playback that
 * responds to the user's actions.
 *
 * If the queue is empty and there is no active music, this method will
 * play the music immediately.  Otherwise, it will add the music to the
 * queue, and it will play as soon as it is removed from the queue.
 *
 * When the begins playing, the music will start at full volume unless you
 * provide a number of seconds to fade in. However, any cross-fade value
 * set in {@link #setOverlap} will be applied independently of the the
 * fade-in value.
 *
 * Note that looping a song will cause it to block the queue indefinitely
 * until you turn off looping for that asset {@see setLoop}. This can be
 * desired behavior, as it gives you a way to control the speed of the
 * queue processing.
 *
 * @param music     The music asset to queue
 * @param loop      Whether to loop the music continuously
