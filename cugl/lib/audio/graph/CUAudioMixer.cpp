//  CUAudioMixer.cpp
//  Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)
//
//  Thie module provides an audio graph node for mixing together several input
//  streams into a single output stream. The input nodes must all have the same
//  same number of channels and sampling rate.
//
//  Mixing works by adding together all of the streams.  This means that the
//  results may exceed the range [-1,1], causing clipping.  The mixer provides
//  a "soft-knee" option for confining the results to the range [-1,1].
