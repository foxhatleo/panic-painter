//  This module is an attempt to combine the power of a modern DSP mixer graph
//  with a simple 2000-era interface. Like the legacy engines, it provides a
//  a flat slot-based structure for playing sounds, and controlling the fade
//  and pan of each slot. It also provides support for music queues.
//
//  However, unlike legacy engines, this engine is not limited to playing
//  music samples. It also allows you to attach and play any arbitrary audio
//  node.  For example, you could combine multiple simultaneous source together
//  and play them together to provide vertical layering.  However, these
//  nodes are still wrapped in a top-level fader to prevent clicking like
//  you can get in OpenAL engines.
