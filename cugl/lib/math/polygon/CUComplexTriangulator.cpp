//  This module is a factory for a Constrained Delaunay triangulator. This
//  is distinct from the normal Delaunay triangulator in that it can handle
//  complex polygons (polygons with holes, but not self-crossings). It is
//  also much more heavy-weight than the other triangulators because it is
//  built on top of the popular poly2tri library
//
//      https://github.com/jhasse/poly2tri
//
//  Because math objects are intended to be on the stack, we do not provide
//  any shared pointer support in this class.
