//  is distinct from the normal Delaunay triangulator in that it can handle
//  complex polygons (polygons with holes, but not self-crossings). It is
//  also much more heavy-weight than the other triangulators because it is
//  built on top of the popular poly2tri library

/**
 * This class is a factory for producing solid Poly2 objects from a set of vertices.
 *
 * For all but the simplist of shapes, it is important to have a triangulator
 * that can divide up the polygon into triangles for drawing. This triangulator
 * uses the poly2tri library to perform a Constrained Delaunay triangulation.
 * This library supports complex polygons, namely those with interior holes
 * (but not self-crossings). All triangles produced are guaranteed to be
 * counter-clockwise.
 *
 * Because the Voronoi diagram is the dual of the Delaunay triangulation, this
 * factory can be used to extract this diagram. The Voronoi diagram can be
 * extracted as either a single polygon (for each point) or a collection of
 * polygons.  Each polygon is a solid Poly2 representing a region.

 * As with all factories, the methods are broken up into three phases:
 * initialization, calculation, and materialization.  To use the factory, you
 * first set the data (in this case a set of vertices or another {@link Poly2})
 * with the initialization methods. You then call the calculation method.
 * Finally, you use the materialization methods to access the data. Unlike
 * the other triangulators, you cannot simply get this triangulation as a
 * set of indices. That is because the triangulation may have added additional
 * vertices.
 *
 * This division allows us to support multithreaded calculation if the data
 * generation takes too long.  However, note that this factory is not thread
 * safe in that you cannot access data while it is still in mid-calculation.
