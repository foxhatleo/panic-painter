//  Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)
//
//  This module provides support for a scissor mask that supports rotation and
//  other transforms.  A scissor mask is a rectangular region that whose size
//  is defined by the extent attribute.  The associated transform transforms
//  this rectangle about its center.
//
//  This module is based on the NVGpaint datatype from nanovg by Mikko Mononen
//  (memon@inside.org). It has been modified to support the CUGL framework.
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.
//
//  With that said, this class looks very similar to the classes in the math 
//  package in that has many methods that assume the object is on the stack and
//  not in a pointer.  That is because we often want to transform these objects
//  with math classes, but we still want shared pointer support for SpriteBatch
//  management.  The result is a class with a bit of a hybrid feel.

/**
 * This class defines a general purpose scissor mask.
 *
 * A scissor mask is used to prevent portions of a 2d shape from showing. The
 * mask is a transformed rectangle, and any pixel outside of this region is
 * dropped. Unlike {@link Gradient}, a scissor is applied to a region of the
 * framebuffer and is not a texture that can be applied to a surface. Therefore,
 * the scissor mask region must be defined in terms of pixels (or at least in
 * the same coordinate system as the vertices it is masking).
 *
 * A scissor mask is defined by three values (in terms of largest to smallest data):
 * 
 * <ul>
 *    <li>An affine transform (for offset and rotation)</li>
 *    <li>A size vector for the extent</li>
 *    <li>A "fringe" value for edge aliasing</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Unpacking this data into std140 format is a 16 element array of floats (the 
 * fringe is expanded into a per-axis value for the shader). And this is the format 
 * that this data is represented in the {@link getData} method so that it can be 
 * passed to a {@link UniformBuffer} for improved performance. It is also possible 
 * to get access to the individual components of the scissor mask, to pass them 
 * to a shader directly (though the transform must be inverted first if it is passed
 * directly).
 *
 * Scissor masks can be intersected.  However, a scissor mask must always be a 
 * transformed rectangle, and not all quadrilateral intersections are guaranteed
 * to be transformed rectangles.  Therefore, these intersections are always an
 * an approximation, with the intersecting scissor mask converted into an 
 * axis-aligned rectangle in the coordinate space of the current scissor mask.
 * The affect is the same as the {@link Rect#inscribe} operation in in {@link Rect}.
