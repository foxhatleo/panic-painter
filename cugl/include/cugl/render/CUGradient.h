//
//  This module provides support for a two-color gradient.  It uses a box
//  gradient definition to support both linear gradients and radial gradients
//  in addition to box gradients.
//
//  This module is based on he NVGpaint datatype from nanovg by Mikko Mononen
//  (memon@inside.org). It has been modified to support the CUGL framework.
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.
//
//  With that said, this class looks very similar to the classes in the math 
//  package in that has many methods that assume the object is on the stack and
//  not in a pointer.  That is because we often want to transform these objects
//  with math classes, but we still want shared pointer support for SpriteBatch
//  management.  The result is a class with a bit of a hybrid feel.

/**
 * This class defines a two color gradient.
 *
 * All gradients, including linear and radial gradients, are variations
 * of (rounded) box gradients. A box gradient is defined by (in terms of
 * largest to smallest data):
 *
 * <ul>
 *    <li>An affine transform (for offset and rotation)</li>
 *    <li>An inner color</li>
 *    <li>An outer color</li>
 *    <li>A size vector of the gradient</li>
 *    <li>A corner radius for the rounded rectangle</li>
 *    <li>A feather factor for the transition speed.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Assuming this data is in std140 format, this is a 24 element array of floats.
 * And this is the format that this data is represented in the {@link getData}
 * method so that it can be passed to a {@link UniformBuffer} for improved 
 * performance. It is also possible to get access to the individual components 
 * of the paint gradient, to pass them to a shader directly (though the transform 
 * must be inverted first if it is passed directly).
 *
 * Paint gradients are applied to surfaces in the same way textures are. The
 * gradient is defined on a unit square from (0,0) to (1,1). To be consistent
 * with textures, the origin is at the top right corner. To apply the gradient,
 * the shader should use the texture coordinates of each vertex (or an attribute
 * similar to texture coordinates) combined with the uniforms for this gradient.
 * For a tutorial on how to do this, see the GradientTexture shaders in the
 * the CUGL render package.
 *
 * For {@link SpriteBatch} and scene graph compatibility, gradients may be tinted 
 * by another color.  This tint is managed separately from the gradient definition.
 *
 * For simplicity we only permit two colors in a gradient.  For multicolored
 * gradients, the shape should be tesellated with multiple gradient values.
