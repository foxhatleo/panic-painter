//  Cornell University Game Library (CUGL)
//
//  This class implements a capsule physics object. A capsule is a box with
//  semicircular ends along the major axis.  They are a popular physics objects,
//  particularly for character avatars.  The rounded ends means they are less
//  likely to snag, and they naturally fall off platforms when they go too far.
//
//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.
