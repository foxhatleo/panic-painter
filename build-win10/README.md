# Windows Libraries

This project will **not** compile without some extra changes to this directory. Games written for Windows must have specific DLLs in order to run.  The project expects them to be in a folder `dll` in this directory.  However, because they are binary files they are omitted from (this) GitHub directory.

This folder can be found in the top-level `build-win10` directory.  It should be copied into this directory before executing the Visual Studio project.
